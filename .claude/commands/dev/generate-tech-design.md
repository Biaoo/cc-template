## Usage

`@generate-tech-design.md`

## Context

- Requirements Document: @spec/requirements.md
- Existing codebase structure and implementation patterns

## Task

According to the requirements document and other related information in this code space, generate a tech design document for the project.
Generate the tech design document in the spec/tech-design.md file.

## Tech Design Guidelines

1. **Architecture Design**: Design the overall technical framework and system architecture
2. **Data Models**: Define core data structures, relationships, and validation rules
3. **API Interfaces**: Design public APIs, method signatures, and interface contracts
4. **Core Logic**: Outline main computational algorithms and business logic flows
5. **Integration Points**: Define how different modules interact and communicate
6. **Performance Considerations**: Address scalability, memory usage, and computational efficiency
7. **Extensibility**: Design for future enhancements and plugin capabilities

## Output Requirements

- Focus on design patterns and architectural decisions, not implementation details
- Include class diagrams, data flow diagrams, and interface specifications, use mermaid to draw them.
- Address both current requirements and future extensibility needs.
- Document trade-offs and design rationale for key decisions.
