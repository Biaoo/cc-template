## Usage

`@optimize-task.md <task-file-path> <optimize-content>`

## Context

- Read the current task content from the task log file: $ARGUMENTS[0]
- Optimize content: $ARGUMENTS[1]

## Process

1. Ultra-think about how to optimize the existing task based on the provided optimization content.
2. Analyze the current task implementation and identify areas for improvement.
3. Read and understand the existing task log file to comprehend the current state.
4. Apply optimization strategies based on the optimization content requirements.
5. Update the task log file with optimization progress and improvements.
6. Implement the optimized solution while maintaining backward compatibility.
7. Document all optimization changes and their rationale in the task log.
8. Begin to implement the optimized solution.

## Output

1. **Optimized Code**: Improved and optimized task implementation.
2. **Task Log Update**: Updated task log file with optimization details.
3. **Optimization Report**: Summary of optimizations made and their benefits.
4. **Next Steps**: Recommendations for further improvements or next development phases.
