# Example Task

**Date**: 2025-07-11  
**Task Status**: In Progress

## Task Description

Implement the core SDK functionality for the TypeScript data management SDK. This includes creating base classes, implementing data validation with Zod schemas, and setting up the foundation for auto-generation tools.

Key components to implement:

- Base SDK client class
- Data model interfaces and types
- Validation layer using Zod schemas
- Error handling and logging utilities
- Configuration management

## Design Plan

1. **Core Architecture Setup**

   - Create base SDK class with initialization methods
   - Implement configuration management for API endpoints and credentials
   - Set up logging and error handling framework

2. **Type System Implementation**

   - Generate TypeScript interfaces from JSON schemas
   - Create Zod validation schemas for runtime type checking
   - Implement type-safe data transformation utilities

3. **Data Management Layer**

   - Implement CRUD operations for data entities
   - Add pagination and filtering capabilities
   - Create data synchronization mechanisms

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up Jest testing framework with ts-jest
   - Create unit tests for core functionality
   - Implement integration tests for API interactions

## Key Decisions During the Task

- **Schema-First Approach**: Decided to use JSON schemas as the source of truth for type generation, ensuring consistency between runtime validation and TypeScript types
- **Zod for Validation**: Chosen over other validation libraries for its TypeScript-first design and excellent type inference
- **Modular Architecture**: Implemented plugin-based architecture to allow for easy extension and customization

## Testing and Validation Results

### Unit Tests

- ✅ Core SDK initialization and configuration
- ✅ Schema validation with Zod
- ⏳ Data transformation utilities (in progress)
- ⏳ Error handling mechanisms (pending)

### Integration Tests

- ⏳ API endpoint integration (pending)
- ⏳ End-to-end data flow validation (pending)

### Performance Tests

- ⏳ Schema validation performance (pending)
- ⏳ Memory usage optimization (pending)

## Task Completion Status

### Completed Items

- [x] Project structure setup with proper TypeScript configuration
- [x] Base SDK class implementation with initialization logic
- [x] Configuration management system
- [x] JSON schema to TypeScript type generation script
- [x] Basic Zod schema generation from JSON schemas
- [x] Core utility functions for data transformation
- [x] ESLint and Prettier configuration
- [x] Jest testing setup with ts-jest preset

### Incomplete Items

- [ ] Complete error handling and logging system
- [ ] Implement pagination and filtering utilities
- [ ] Add data caching mechanisms
- [ ] Complete API client integration
- [ ] Finalize documentation generation
- [ ] Add comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Performance optimization and benchmarking

## Outstanding Issues

- Issue 1: Type generation script needs optimization for large schemas - Priority: Medium
- Issue 2: Memory usage during schema validation needs investigation - Priority: Low
- Issue 3: API rate limiting implementation pending design review - Priority: High

## Next Steps

1. Complete the error handling and logging system implementation
2. Add comprehensive unit tests for all utility functions
3. Implement API client with proper authentication and rate limiting
4. Create example usage scenarios in the examples directory
5. Set up continuous integration pipeline
6. Conduct performance testing and optimization
7. Prepare initial documentation and API reference
