## Architecture

### Project Structure

<!-- example-start -->

- **`src/core/`** - Core classes and base functionality
- **`src/types/`** - Generated TypeScript types from JSON schemas
- **`src/schemas/`** - Generated Zod schemas for validation
- **`src/utils/`** - Utility functions
- **`scripts/`** - Code generation scripts
- **`test/`** - Test files
- **`examples/`** - Path used for writing SDK usage examples
<!-- example-end -->

### Key Tech Stack

<!-- example-start -->
- TypeScript
- Zod
- Jest
- ESLint
- Prettier
<!-- example-end -->

## Memory & Progress Management

This section is for recording long-term project memory and tracking development progress. Claude Code should always refer to this section during development and update following the rules below.

### 1. Memory Documents

Memory documents are stored in the @docs/ directory.

project-root/
├── docs/
│   ├── requirements.md
│   ├── tech-design.md
│   ├── development-progress.md
│   ├── develop-logs/
│   └── ...

- @docs/requirements.md: Project requirements and design.
- @docs/tech-design.md: The technical design of the whole project and key functional modules.
- @docs/development-progress.md: The ongoing progress, completed tasks, and next steps.
- @docs/develop-logs/*: Logs of development process, managed following the rules in @docs/development-progress.md.

### 2. How to Use & Maintain

- **Reference**: Before coding, answering questions, or making decisions, always check the above documents to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Update**: After implementing features, fixing bugs, or making key decisions, promptly update the relevant documents to keep project memory current and complete.
- **Progress Tracking**: The progress document should clearly list current version, major changes, next goals, and known issues for easy tracking and collaboration.
- **Logs Management**: The logs should be managed following the rules in @docs/development-progress.md.
- **Don't Change Content**: Do not change the parts marked (Don't Change) in the documents.

### Development Notes

<!-- example-start -->
- The project uses TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier are configured for code quality, command: `npm run lint` and `npm run format`
- Jest is used for testing with ts-jest preset
- Git strategy could be found in @docs/git-strategy.md, always follow the strategy when developing
- Don't modify the types in @src/types/ and @src/schemas/ directly, they are generated by @scripts/generate-types.ts and @scripts/generate-zod-schemas.ts.
- Instead of `npm build`, you can use `tsx` to run the test script.
